# Add Register HTML Template with HTMX

## Notes
- User requested a registration HTML template using HTMX.
- No 'templates' directory was found in the project structure.
- base.html and registration/register.html templates have been created.
- accounts app already has API-based RegisterView. Need to add Django views for HTML/HTMX registration.
- User requested a catch-all route to redirect to register if path does not exist.
- Tests are needed for registration page and catch-all redirection.

## Task List
- [x] Create a 'templates' directory if it doesn't exist.
- [x] Add a registration HTML template that uses HTMX.
- [ ] Integrate the template into the Django registration flow (views, URLs).
  - [ ] Add Django view for rendering registration form (HTML).
  - [ ] Add HTMX validation endpoints (username, password).
  - [ ] Add URLs for registration and validation endpoints.
  - [ ] Add catch-all route to redirect to registration page if path does not exist.
- [ ] Ensure HTMX is loaded and functional in the template.
- [ ] Add tests for registration page and catch-all redirection.

## Current Goal
Integrate registration flow: views, URLs, and tests.
